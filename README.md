<h1>A TODO list in Assembly</h1>

That's right, due to the blazingly fast speed I develop at, I needed to write an 
app that could keep track of what i'm doing and keep up with just how fast I am, 
therefore I had no choice but to write a todo list cli tool in assembly, the only
language capable of keeping up with me! <br><br>

<h2>Developer log</h2>

25th of June, 2025<br><br>
I have mostly written this already in gas over here:<br> 
- https://github.com/dynamicmemory/side-projects/tree/main/assembly-todo-list <br>
For my operating systems class I have to code in nasm, so I thought this would be a 
good quick project  to help me switch up the syntax in my brain. This project was so much 
fun to write the first time and this time I plan on trying to split up the code more 
and simplify the design. I don't have a great deal of time at the moment so hopefully
this doesn't take too long... but I love writting in assembly so really I don't mind
sinking all my free time in here.
