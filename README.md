<h1>A TODO list in Assembly</h1>

That's right, due to the blazingly fast speed I develop at, I needed to write an 
app that could keep track of what i'm doing and keep up with just how fast I am, 
therefore I had no choice but to write a todo list cli tool in assembly, the only
language capable of keeping up with me! <br><br>

<b><u><h3>25th of June, 2025<h3><u><b><br><br>
I have mostly written this already in gas over here:<br> 
- https://github.com/dynamicmemory/side-projects/tree/main/assembly-todo-list <br>
For my operating systems class I have to code in nasm, so I thought this would be a 
good quick project  to help me switch up the syntax in my brain. This project was so much 
fun to write the first time and this time I plan on trying to split up the code more 
and simplify the design. I don't have a great deal of time at the moment so hopefully
this doesn't take too long... but I love writting in assembly so really I don't mind
sinking all my free time in here.

Skipped a day yesterday, had some "tough" AI code to write for uni... ok it wasn't 
tough, but I was struggling so my free time went there yesterday. Anyway as for this
project, another hour put into it and its coming along nicely. Read, write, newline,
command, cleanbuffer, trying to think of what else was implemented tonight... Pretty 
simple coming from gas to nasm, nasm has some things i like for sure, mainly not having 
to throw a % every other key, but not labelling things with $ or % feels a little to 
free in the language. Getting used to different keywords and derefferencing memory. But 
its not to hard, i fucking love writting in assembly, the goated language. That's all 
I got, nothing interesting today really. When i tackle delete and write2std... that 
will be the interesting day (maybe) I remember both being a little tricky.
